You are a developer, and you want to convince your company to develop FOSS. You are a manager and you can not even say the word "Linux" (it may not be as easy as you think) but you want good products cheap, and you want your programmers to be happy. You are a company owner, educator or government official and you wonder if using free software will bring you love ... and money.
