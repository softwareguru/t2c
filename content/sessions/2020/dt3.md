LiteFarm is a free and open source farm management tool made for current and aspiring sustainable farmers. LiteFarm is developed in cooperation with a team of farmers, scientists, and software professionals at the University of British Columbia as well as contributors such as yourself. This presentation will focus briefly on the sustainable agriculture sector and how the LiteFarm community is leveraging the strengths of open source to positively impact as many farmers as possible.
