I am a software engineer passionate about user interface design and the free and open source development model.

Since 2009 I have contributed to the GNOME community in various fronts. I started as a translator, but later I got engaged into marketing and outreach activities by organizing and speaking about GNOME at free software conferences.

As a result of my enjoyment of the role, I decided to pursue a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Universidade Federal de Pelotas.

A couple of years later I applied and was accepted in the Google Summer of Code internship program where I learnt the essentials of software engineering by working in the GNOME community during the summer.

Currently I live in Brno, in the lovely Czech Republic, where I joined the Red Hat Desktop Team to work in GNOME technologies and applications.

I blog about my GNOME contributions here. In my Twitter account I dump thoughts about software engineering, infosec, politics, rap, and football.
