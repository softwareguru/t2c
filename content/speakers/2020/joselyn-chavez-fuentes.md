I am a mexican Ph.D. Student at the Biotechnology Institute-UNAM in Merinoâ€™s Lab focused on bioinformatics analysis of transcriptional regulators in bacteria.

I have used R programming language during the last 4 years and since 2018 started developing my own packages. I have been awarded with scholarships from Bioconductor and RStudio to present my work as a developer at BioC Conference 2019 and 2020, and attend RStudioConf in 2020.

I am interested on expanding the community of R users and developers. Recently, I joined the board team of the Community of Software Developers for Bioinformatics and co-founded R-Ladies Cuernavaca.
