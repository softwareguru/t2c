Political scientist turned coder, Lorena Mesa is a GitHub data 
engineer, Director & Chair of the Python Software Foundation, JOSS
 editor, and PyLadies Chicago co-organizer. Lorena's time at Obama for 
America and her subsequent graduate research required her to learn how 
to transform messy, incomplete data into intelligible analysis on topics
 like predicting Latinx voter behavior. It's this unique background in 
research and applied mathematics that drove Lorena to pursue a career in
 engineering and data science. One part activist, one part Star Wars 
fanatic, and another part Trekkie, Lorena abides by the motto to "live long and prosper"
