Jarek is an Engineer with a broad experience in many subjects - Open-Source, Cloud, Mobile, Robotics, AI, Backend, Developer Experience, but he also had a lot of non-engineering experience - running a company, being CTO, organizing big, international community events, technical sales support, pr and marketing advisory but also looking at legal aspect of licensing and building open-source communities are all under his belt.

With the experience in very small and very big companies and everything in-between, Jarek found his place in Open-Source world, where his internal individual-contributor drive can be used to the uttermost of the potential.
